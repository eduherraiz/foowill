Foowill
=======

Foowill was my first full-stack django project.

Django 1.4 + Celery (Periodic Tasks) + Redis (Cache)

It's a twitter app, that looking periodically in your account if you publish tweets. In the case that the configurable time limit is raised the stored tweets in the app will be published in your twitter account.
Useful to save the last thoughts and share it if you die.
The project starts in 2012, and in October 2013 was closed.
